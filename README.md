# B-Spline Fitting

This repository contains code for fitting a B-spline to a dataset, plotting the fit, and displaying the spline subcomponents \( c_i N_i(x) \).

## Overview

B-splines (Basis splines) are a family of piecewise-defined polynomials that are used in computational graphics and data fitting. 
They offer great flexibility and can model complex curves while maintaining a smooth overall shape.

## Features

- Fit a B-spline to provided data points.
- Visualize the fitted B-spline along with the original data.
- Show the individual spline subcomponents.
